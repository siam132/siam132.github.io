          <p> I am and always been a huge fan of building. This includes bilding figures
               using lego pieces, building projects from scratch using nothing but lines of code,
               shooting photos of different moments, or even drawing something on the paper 
               using a pencil.

                My passion for building has always been my main source of motivation.</p>

           <p>I come from a third world country called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh" target="_blank">bangladesh</a>. 
                Which happens to be Asia's one of the poorest country. 
                I was always driven towards technology form a young age. 
                Every toy that I had would get dismentled by time it would
                get out of the box. I just always had a burning curiosity to know 
                how the whole thing work. How each part played its role to complete 
                the entirity of the mechanism. With the passion I came to America 
                In search of a better life. Got admitted into a high school 
                and since then my thirst for knowledge was never quenched.

            <img src="images/about/new_utrecht.jpg" style="padding:8px" class="image screenshot left" alt="High school">
            <p>I went to a pretty mediocre <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/New_Utrecht_High_School_2007.JPG" target="_blank">high school</a> here in brooklyn. However by no
                 means can I discredit
                 the great people that I met along the way. I was also part of the wrestling team 
                 which taught me far more than any class room ever could. I dont say this to undermine 
                 the value of education but I just think that not everything is learned from books.
                 It helped see things a little differently. Things just got a little easier after 
                 wrestling.

                    I am currently attending Brooklyn College. Pursuing my B.S in computer 
                    Science. I just knew I had a thing for computers. In a world full of 
                    uncertainty, the one thing I can rely on for a definitive behavior is a 
                    computer. Seems a bit odd for someone to find more comfort in a machine rather 
                    than a person. Odd indeed....

            <h1>Goals and aspiration</h1>
            <p>
                To be completely honest, its really hard to be focused on what's 
                important nowadays. With so many distractions. However, one day 
                I hope to work for the worlds most innovative company. I always saw
                the news and how the technology advances at a rate that we can't  quite concieve.
                I wanna be a part of something that makes the world a better place.
